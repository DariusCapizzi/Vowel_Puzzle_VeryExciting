# Vowels -the Puzzle

#### Behavior-driven development independent project for epicodus

#### by Darius Capizzi
## Description
A simple java function with some very troubled routing with Spark. Unsure of how move between routes except in forms, the Strings jumps around in hidden input fields.  The user enters a string, and then later guesses what the vowels were in that string. Though, since that value is in the query string at that time (because it is a get request), the whole idea of guessing is sort of compromised.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Clone repository,
* Install gradle
* enter "gradle run" in the repositories directory
* in your browser go to "localhost:4567"
* enter a word into the fields, and click
* try and guess what the word is from only consonants, your memory and where it is written at the top of your browser.
* if you guess wrong, try again, if you guess correctly, enter a new word.

## Known Bugs
the whole "hidden input field" in forms bugs me, and I am unsure of its validity as a practice.

## Technologies Used
* Velocity Template Engine
* Apache Spark
* Java
* Gradle
